# Godot 2D Chess

This is a fork of https://github.com/henriiquecampos/Chess-game-in-Godot/.

A simple 2D chess game made in Godot.

## Make a VR Chess Game
I have no experience with Godot, but I love the game engine.

This source might be just the nudge I need to create a chess game for VR. Specifically,
making a chess game for Oculus Quest.

Hopefully I can use this chess engine to drive the 3D chess game. I just started looking
at the scripts.

## Features

1. En passant seems to be correctly supported.
2. Castling seems to be correctly supported.


## Known Issues

1. There os no checks for Stalemate, Check or Checkmate.
2. Moves that puts the King in jeopardy is not prevented.
3. There are some hard to reproduce capture bugs (seen only with pawns so far).
