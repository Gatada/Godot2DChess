# Godot 2D Chess

This is a work of sort from https://github.com/henriiquecampos/Chess-game-in-Godot/.

A simple 2D chess game made in Godot.

## Make a VR Chess Game
I have no experience with Godot, but I love the game engine.

This source might be just the nudge I need to create a chess game for VR. Specifically,
making a chess game for Oculus Quest.

Hopefully I can use this chess engine to drive the 3D chess game. I just started looking
at the scripts.

## Features

1. En passant seems to be correctly supported.
2. Castling seems to be correctly supported.


## Known Issues

1. There seems to be no checks for Check nor Checkmate.
